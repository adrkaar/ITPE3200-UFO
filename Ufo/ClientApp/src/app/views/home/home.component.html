    <p> An unidentified flying object (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unidentified_flying_object" target="_blank">UFO</a>) more recently renamed 
        by US officials as a UAP (unidentified aerial phenomenon), is any perceived aerial phenomenon that cannot be immediately identified or explained. On investigation, 
        most UFOs are identified as known objects or atmospheric phenomena, while a small number remain unexplained.</p>
    <p> The purpose of this site is not only to create a database, but also to gather people interested in the development of such a science as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ufology" target="_blank"> ufology </a> .</p>
